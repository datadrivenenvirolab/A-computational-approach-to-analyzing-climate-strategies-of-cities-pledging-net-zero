[FROM ACTION]  Introduction:  The City of Cambridge is located in southeast Middlesex County across the Charles River from the City of Boston, and occupies a land area of 6.26 square miles. The City is bordered by the Towns of Watertown and Belmont on the west and by the Town of Arlington and the City of Somerville on the north.  First settled in 1630, Cambridge was incorporated as a town in 1636 and became a city in 1846. Since 1942, the City has had a council-manager form of government with nine City Councillors elected at-large every two years.  The City Council elects a Mayor and Vice Mayor from among its members with the Mayor also serving as Chair of the School Committee. The City Manager is the Chief Administrative Officer and carries out the policies of the City Council. With the assistance of a Deputy City Manager and three Assistant City Managers, the City Manager coordinates the functions of 34 municipal departments and is responsible for the delivery of services to residents. The City Manager is appointed by the City Council and serves at the pleasure of the Council.  Cambridge is a dense and ethnically diverse urban city.  Only 10 U.S. cities with a population over 50,000 are denser. 67% of all residents are white; 12% are black; 15% are Asian; 8% are Hispanic, and 6% are other races, including American Indian, Pacific Islander, or two or more races in combination. 25% of residents are foreign born, and one third of residents speak a language other than English at home.   The majority of residents are renters, living in multifamily housing. 65.4% of all households rent and only 7.5% of homes are single family; 49.8% of Cambridge households are in buildings with 13 or more units.  The City provides a wide range of services including police and fire protection; education; refuse collection; snow and leaf removal; traffic control; building inspections; licenses and permits; vital statistics; construction and maintenance of streets and other infrastructure; water distribution; recreational and cultural activities; library services; community development; and other human service programs. Cambridge is widely known as the University City. Harvard, America’s oldest university was established here in 1636, six years after the City itself was founded in 1630. It is also home to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Lesley University and Cambridge College. Over one-fourth of residents are students, and more than one in four of all jobs are in these institutions. Yet Cambridge is more than a university city. It features high-tech workers and professionals, political activists, street musicians and immigrants from around the world. Due to its strong and healthy local economy, the City retained the rare distinction of being one of 34 municipalities in the United States with three AAA ratings from the nation’s three major credit rating agencies. The City has received AAA ratings from Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings every year since 1999. Cambridge also has a strong reputation for being a leader in environmental sustainability.  The City formed the Climate Protection Action Committee in 2000 and completed its first climate actions plan in 2003.  More recently, the City received 5 Star certification from STAR Communities, has undertaken a robust climate vulnerability assessment, and has completed a Net Zero Action Plan that puts the City on a path to achieving net zero emissions from building energy use at the community wide scale.  ;  The Net Zero Action Plan also has implementation time frames for when new development needs to be net zero.; Does this target align with the global 1.5 - 2°C pathway set out in the Paris agreement?

From the famous icon of the Golden Gate Bridge to the California Academy of Sciences and the Transamerica Pyramid, the city takes pride in its attractions, renowned museums, and residential neighborhoods, which are treasures of their own. San Francisco is a consolidated city and county (CCSF) with a population of approximately 884,363. The city is located on the tip of the San Francisco Peninsula with the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay bordering it on three sides. The climate is relatively mild with average temperatures ranging from 11.3 (Jan) to 17.6 (Sep) degrees Celsius. The economy is driven primarily by tourism, financial, and technology companies. The population is diverse, including over 100 spoken languages with Chinese as the most frequently spoken language in the home after English. Consistent with the scientific community’s recommendations to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050 to stabilize our climate system, San Francisco has officially codified ambitious emission reduction goals, including 20% reduction below 1990 levels for 2012, 25% by 2017, 40% by 2025 and has committed to net zero by 2050. We have not only met, but exceeded both our 2012 and 2017 goals, currently have reduced emissions 36% (2017 data).; Does this target align with the global 1.5 - 2°C pathway set out in the Paris agreement?

We simply ask businesses to commit to close their doors when running heat and AC and provide them with a branded logo and free promotion to thank them.  Although already illegal in places like New York City, this behavior is common around the country, and collectively it adds up to enormous amounts of wasted electricity and associated pollution.Keep It Cool goals:1.	Encourage retailers to adopt the policy of keeping doors closed.2.	Promote the energy- and pollution-savings of participating retailers, and give them an opportunity to demonstrate their values to customers. 3.	Spread an energy-aware culture among consumers and retailers.The City enacted an anti-idling ordinance in 2015 restricting idling to 90 seconds when in public right of way, recognizing that the transportation sector is the single largest contributor to overall greenhouse gas emissions within the City and that auto exhaust exacerbates respiratory illnesses such as asthma. The City has become aware of excessive idling throughout the City but does not have the capacity to enforce its ordinance city-wide. Lengthy idling commonly occurs in school zones while parents and caretakers wait to pick up their children. The City is taking a multi-prong approach to reducing transportation emissions and would like to invite the City’s public and private schools to join these efforts through a simple anti-idling campaign.The City’s Climate Action Program has identified partnering with City schools to bring awareness to this issue and discourage idling as a priority action. The measures the Climate Action Program proposes will collectively avoid tons of greenhouse gas emissions and promote better health outcomes for those who are at risk of respiratory illness. In sum the campaign asks drivers to commit to turning off their engines whenever parked outside of schools. The City installed anti idling signs in school right of ways and pick up zones and provided signs to schools to install in their parking lots.

We simply ask businesses to commit to close their doors when running heat and AC and provide them with a branded logo and free promotion to thank them.  Although already illegal in places like New York City, this behavior is common around the country, and collectively it adds up to enormous amounts of wasted electricity and associated pollution.Keep It Cool goals:1.	Encourage retailers to adopt the policy of keeping doors closed.2.	Promote the energy- and pollution-savings of participating retailers, and give them an opportunity to demonstrate their values to customers. 3.	Spread an energy-aware culture among consumers and retailers.The City enacted an anti-idling ordinance in 2015 restricting idling to 90 seconds when in public right of way, recognizing that the transportation sector is the single largest contributor to overall greenhouse gas emissions within the City and that auto exhaust exacerbates respiratory illnesses such as asthma. The City has become aware of excessive idling throughout the City but does not have the capacity to enforce its ordinance city-wide. Lengthy idling commonly occurs in school zones while parents and caretakers wait to pick up their children. The City is taking a multi-prong approach to reducing transportation emissions and would like to invite the City’s public and private schools to join these efforts through a simple anti-idling campaign.The City’s Climate Action Program has identified partnering with City schools to bring awareness to this issue and discourage idling as a priority action. The measures the Climate Action Program proposes will collectively avoid tons of greenhouse gas emissions and promote better health outcomes for those who are at risk of respiratory illness. In sum the campaign asks drivers to commit to turning off their engines whenever parked outside of schools. The City installed anti idling signs in school right of ways and pick up zones and provided signs to schools to install in their parking lots.

This means that none of the City of Sydney’s domestic waste is sent directly to landfill. The City recognises that disposal of untreated waste to landfill is no longer a responsible waste management option. Loss of potential resources and environmental harm arise from methane gas emissions from decomposing garbage. Methane as a greenhouse gas is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide.  Establishing a treatment facility suitable for energy recovery to further reduce emissions is part of an integrated suite of long term waste solutions being investigated by the City. The aim is to incorporate waste treatment with the City’s Renewable Energy Master Plan.;;action_description8: The City’s Clean Streets program aims to improve cleanliness of the City’s streets and laneways, reduce clutter and increase community pride. Waste education staff has permanently removed up to 35 residential garbage and recycling bins from being stored in City's eastern suburbs by establishing internal waste collection from within the residential apartment buildings in the area. Many of the properties had minimal waste storage areas and coupled with frequent collection meant that bins were often left out on the street attracting illegal dumping and littering. The new internal collection arrangement was the result of extensive stakeholder engagement with the residents, building managers and business owners in the community and has made a dramatic improvement on the amenity of the area.  The City developed and launched an illegal dumping awareness campaign, ‘Want a tip? in November to support its Clean Street program. The campaign set out to increase awareness of the City’s free pick-up service, and also increase the number of bookings generated for the service. ‘Want a tip?’ also informed people that dumping is illegal and that fines can apply.;;action_description9: Develop a net zero carbon buildings roadmap for residential apartment buildings.

In addition, our new local planning controls will increase the number of car sharing spaces provided in new commercial and residential developments;;action_description11: The Sydney region is facing a waste disposal bottleneck with landfills reaching capacity by 2021 and available waste processing falling well short of demand. The Renewable Energy Master Plan identified that after recycling, the remaining waste generated within the City of Sydney by both residents or businesses could be converted into electricity. The Advanced Waste Treatment Master Plan reviews the technologies available internationally that could achieve this vision. It sets out the potential reduction in levels of domestic, commercial and industrial waste going to landfill as non-recycled waste as well as the portion of renewable energy that could be produced by the City’s community domestic, commercial and industrial waste. Rather than replacing recycling, the City’s draft plan calls for a facility that could recover the energy resource remaining in waste after the best recycling efforts have been undertaken. This would help the City avoid greenhouse gas emissions from waste ending up at landfill, and replace some of the emissions from the use of fossil fuel for energy use.;;action_description12: Sydney plans to be the first City in Australia to replace all of its public lighting portfolio with energy-efficient LEDs. The City is partnering with Ausgrid (our local electricity utility) to fast track the upgrade of utility-owned street lights in the next two years. The upgrade involves replacement of conventional street light fittings (e.g. mercury vapour, compact fluorescent, sodium) with more energy-efficient LED street lights. – Stage One of the upgrade involves 3,500 utility-owned street lights on residential streets and other minor roads. This will reduce emission by about 1,000 tonnes a year.– Stage Two of the upgrade involves 6,500 utility-owned street lights on main roads and in places with high public lighting levels (e.g. commercial centres). This will reduce emissions by another 2,400 tonnes a year.;;action_description13: The City's Energy Efficiency Master Plan shows that energy usage would increase by 26 per cent by 2030 if all energy efficiency programs were removed. Instead, the Master Plan proposes a target to reduce the net energy used by buildings in the City of Sydney local government area by 31 per cent by 2030 on 2006 levels. The Master Plan shows how this can be achieved, despite significant growth in the economy and new floor space by 2030. This is equivalent to a doubling of energy productivity. The Master Plan includes 11 enabling actions to achieve this target.   Implementing the Master Plan is the single biggest action the City can take to meet our target of a 70 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 based on 2006 levels within the local government area.

We have created 10km of separated cycleways, 60km of shared paths and 40km of other infrastructure. This equates to 110km of the City's planned 200km network already complete.  Where separated paths have been introduced the number of bike trips have doubled and trebled in some places. Overall the number of bike trips has doubled in the past 3 years. Commuter periods are peak cycling times, proving that it is being used as a viable get-to-work transport option.  The City is also behind a series of bike-riding and bike-maintenance courses to ensure locals are armed with everything they need to be self-sufficient cyclists.

In 2012 the NSW Government began the extension of the Inner West Light Rail line and announced the CBD and South East Light Rail project.  The new CBD and South East Light Rail will travel from Circular Quay along George Street to Central Station and on to Moore Park, then to Kingsford via Anzac Parade and Randwick via Alison Road and High Street. Work on the 12km CBD and South East Light Rail route has begun and will be staged over 3 years, across 31 construction zones. The NSW Government expects light rail to be operating in 2019.;;action_description30: The City promotes safe and courteous cycling with free bike tune ups, bells, maps and sessions through our StreetShare program. A key project within the StreetShare program is Share the Path (STP) campaign.

Our weekly maintenance courses continue to be very well attended with numbers averaging 8 participants each week. The bike balance clinics for children are increasingly popular, with children as young as three developing riding skills.;;action_description34: The City collects and manages around 65,000 tonnes of waste each year from more than 115,000 households and around 11,000 tonnes from City-managed assets, parks and public places. Residential apartments make up more than 75% of households in the city. Many of these households have competing demands for space, particularly storage allocation for waste and recycling. Sending waste to landfill has the least economic and environmental benefit. While waste disposal costs continue to increase, recycling certain materials has a market value. Separating recyclables for reprocessing into new products presents great opportunities. To maximise total resource recovery, and minimise waste entering landfill the City needs to investigate alternative solutions for treatment of the remaining items.;;action_description35: The Sustainable Destination Partnership is a collaboration of hotels, backpacker hostels, serviced apartments, cultural institutions, entertainment venues and industry influencers working together to make Sydney a sustainable destination. Sydney is Australia’s leading destination for tourists and the gateway to NSW. The tourism sector is a vital component of the city's economy and an important contributor to national and international recognition of Sydney being a great place to visit, live and work. But this popularity comes at a price with accommodation and entertainment venues creating 47% of Sydney’s commercial waste, 21% of its carbon emissions and consuming 14% of its drinking water. We are taking action. Sustainable Destination Partnership was launched in June 2018 with 40 founding members. These members represent almost half of Sydney’s hotel rooms, the majority of our well-known cultural and entertainment venues and key industry associations and supporters. Informed by the City of Sydney’s Sustainable Sydney 2030 vision, the partnership is working on projects that will reduce our environmental impact, while saving money and attracting new customers.Data in this report on emissions savings and cost of program is given on program lifetime forecast basis (FY17 to FY22);;action_description36: The Green Villages program conducts regular energy efficiency workshops for residential apartments that run through the basics of energy use, bills and simple actions to increase efficiency;;action_description37: CitySwitch Green Office is a national office tenant energy efficiency program run in partnership with the local governments of Sydney, North Sydney, Willoughby, Adelaide, Perth, Melbourne and the national partner: Net Balance Foundation.

The program provides advice, resources and recognition to participants who commit to achieving highly energy efficient offices as measured by the NABERS Energy rating system.Data in this report describes achievements and costs of CitySwitch Sydney program only (not entire national CitySwitch program).Emissions saved and cost of program data is given on program lifetime to date basis (FY13 to FY18).;;action_description38: ;;action_description39: The City recognises the popularity of walking, with over 92 per cent of trips in the city centre by walking and over 29 per cent of employed residents walking to work. The City’s first Walking Strategy and Action Plan was endorsed by Council in April 2015.  Following a successful pilot program, rollout of the City’s new comprehensive wayfinding and tactile signage network begins in 2016. The $8 million Legible Sydney Wayfinding System will link central Sydney streets using around 2,100 tactile and braille street signs, pedestrian-friendly maps, information pylons, new signs and digital technology.;;action_description40: The Smart Green Business Program, run in partnership with Sydney Water assists medium to large non-office based businesses (for example: hotels, entertainment, conference facilities and retailers) in the local government area to improve their environmental performance. The program provides hands on sustainability advice and implementation support for water and waste reduction and provides referral to State energy efficiency programs.;;action_description41: The City of Sydney is building a 200km network of which about 55km will be separated cycleways – and is now concentrating on building or upgrading 10 priority regional routes. We have created 10km of separated cycleways, 60km of shared paths and 40km of other infrastructure. This equates to 110km of the City's planned 200km network already complete.  Where separated paths have been introduced the number of bike trips have doubled and trebled in some places. Overall the number of bike trips has doubled in the past 3 years. Commuter periods are peak cycling times, proving that it is being used as a viable get-to-work transport option.  The City is also behind a series of bike-riding and bike-maintenance courses to ensure locals are armed with everything they need to be self-sufficient cyclists.  Major cycling festivals and events are also supported, including National Ride2Work Day, Bicycle NSW's Spring Cycle and the Sydney Bike Film Festival.;;action_description42: The Green Villages program works to drive, build and celebrate sustainable villages through the development of local sustainability programs, events and resources.

From its industrial past, Green Square is emerging as a place of innovative housing design, bespoke business and retail, and creative and engaged communities proud of their area’s past and future.  Green Square is set to become a new exemplar of sustainable high density living with developments linked to recycled water, shops, parks, gardens, entertainment, and bike and walking routes.  In September 2013, the City entered into a contract with a private utility for the design, construction, operation, maintenance and administration of the Green Square Water Reuse project for up to 10 years. The project will deliver up to 320 million litres of recycled stormwater to the new buildings and open spaces in the Green Square Town Centre, saving precious drinking water and reducing water bills for residents.;;action_description44: From April 2011 all domestic waste has been processed at Suez Environmental Solutions Advanced Waste Treatment (AWT) Facilities. This means that none of the City of Sydney’s domestic waste is sent directly to landfill. The City recognises that disposal of untreated waste to landfill is no longer a responsible waste management option. Loss of potential resources and environmental harm arise from methane gas emissions from decomposing garbage. Methane as a greenhouse gas is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide.  Establishing a treatment facility suitable for energy recovery to further reduce emissions is part of an integrated suite of long term waste solutions being investigated by the City.",NA,2030,70,Carbonn2019;C40Cities2019;GlobalCovenantofMayors2019;CDPCities2018;NAZCA,4,1,9328.76,24.93588859,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the same time, reducing emissions caused by growing public transport is a significant and exemplary climate measure.Public transport in Turku will be turned into a carbon neutral service by 2029. Electrification of lines proceeds in the pace enabled by technical development and competitive tendering and electrification is complemented with biofuel solutions. The service capacity of public transport will be significantly improved in order to implement the strategic carbon neutrality objective of the City of Turku and to support sustainable and attractive urban development. – Carbon neutral public transport system of large capacity (separate decision) – Improved public transport services (trunk routes, route planning, guaranteed transfer, smart buses and systems) – The use of public transport will be significantly promoted by means of urban and traffic planning– The public transport service will be subject to active communication and its use will be supported with campaigns and spreading of information.– Public transport is a strong and natural part of trip chains and development and implementation of Mobility as a Service concepts. Innovative businesses and developers have a significant role as solution makers.Active mobility and development of public transport have an important role in the implementation of a carbon neutral Turku. Simultaneously, they have a positive impact on the healthiness and safety of urban environment, the physical and psychological wellbeing of citizens and quality of life. New mobility solutions also represent a significant development target and platform for innovations and business. The share of walking, cycling and public transport will be increased through active measures in accordance with objectives of Master plan 2029. The objective for the share of sustainable means of transport according to Turku master plan and the Structural Model 2035 for the Turku Urban Region is over 66 per cent in 2030.;;action_description13: All heat from waste-waters recaptured and used for disctric heating and cooling.

Without tree felling, the carbon absorption of forests owned by the City of Turku already compensates for passenger car emissions in the Turku area. Increasing the carbon absorption capacity of vegetation and soil is affordable in terms of costs and it also has other significant positive effects. Carbon sinks, production of renewable energy and other compensations must be increased to reach carbon neutrality and to become a climate positive area. In accordance with its strategy, the City of Turku looks after the carbon stock in the soil and vegetation by striving towards increasing green areas and maintaining forests, fields and the amount of vegetation within its area and preferring naturalness in planting areas. New kinds of urban nature and green area development will be increased as the city becomes more condensed. - Maintaining carbon sinks will be taken into consideration in updating the city’s forest plan. Fragmented green infrastructure is fixed by forestation of suitable field areas. - New land areas will be acquired with trees when possible, and forest property will not be used to compensate for a short-term cash deficit. - Urban parks and related green infrastructure will be further developed to mitigate climate change (carbon sinks) and to support preparedness (runoff waters, effect on microclimate).- Green-blue factor will be taken into use in construction planning. Maintaining soil and using long-lasting woodwork will be preferred in construction. Using wood as construction material is developed and its share is increased. - Carbon stock in vegetation and soil and carbon sinks will be calculated every four years.

Yes - 1.5 °C [FROM ACTION]  Introduction:  Vancouver is located on the west coast of Canada. With a population of 631,486 people (2016 census), Vancouver is the eighth largest Canadian city and Metro Vancouver is the third largest region in Canada. Vancouver enjoys an international reputation as the world’s most livable city, reinforced again in 2009 by The Economist. In 2010, Vancouver ranked second on the EIU Greenest City Index, thanks to bold decisions made by our predecessors, such as protecting the watersheds of the North Shore mountains, creating Stanley Park, maintaining public access to long stretches of the waterfront, and rejecting freeways through the city.   More recently, Vancouver was one of the first cities in the world to recognize the threat posed by climate change, with the Clouds of Change Task Force recommending in 1990 that we begin reducing CO2 emissions. Today, we have the Greenest City Action Plan (GCAP), adopted in 2011 as a comprehensive climate action plan to support the city's transformation to a low-carbon, thriving economy. The GCAP outlines the City's goals and targets with respect to climate change. There are 10 goal areas and 17 targets supporting actions that are managed by different departments in the City and are monitored and reported on by the Sustainability Department. The Renewable City Action Plan approved by City Council in 2017 commits the City of Vancouver (not just the corporation) to derive 100% of its community-wide energy from renewable sources before 2050. The City also became one of the first in Canada to declare a climate emergency. Our Climate Emergency Response (2019) sets out six Big Moves and a suite of accelerated actions to keep Vancouver's emissions on a IPCC-compliant trajectory by rapidly decreasing our community emissions by 50% before 2030, to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.Vancouver is also a leader in city-level adaptation. The City's Climate Adaptation Strategy, which was adopted by Council in 2012 and updated in 2018, is a forecast and plan for adapting to the future impacts of climate change.; Does this target align with the global 1.5 - 2°C pathway set out in the Paris agreement?

A maximum of € 15,000 per power storage system is granted. If the storage or the energy management system has a forecast-based operating strategy, a bonus of € 300 is added. Eligible applicants are private individuals as well as companies which have their residence or a branch in Berlin.;;action_description2: Waste prevention and high-quality waste recycling are also part of a climate-neutral Berlin. Therefore, the BEK supports the nationwide introduction of the bio bin by accompanying Kamapgenen. An information campaign ""Nachbarn werben Nachbarn"" in garden-rich neighborhoods was started at the beginning of May 2019. In addition, gastronomic establishments should be specifically advertised, food leftovers trimmed together and used.;;action_description3: Berlin’s administration aims to set a good example in climate-friendly behaviour for its citizens. Climate protection mainly comes down to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by cutting energy use and replacing fossil fuels with renewables. That is why the Berlin Energy Turnaround Act requires the central and district administrations to organise their work in a carbon-neutral manner by the year 2030. The legislation also requires the establishment of refurbishment roadmaps for public buildings, in which the building stock of the central and district administrations will be systematically documented, and the necessary energy-related refurbishment measures put into an expedient order of priority. By implementing these refurbishment roadmaps, public building stock will be comprehensively refurbished for energy efficiency by 2050.;;action_description4: The heating exchange program of the Senate Department for Environment, Transport and Climate Protection will support the replacement of oil heating systems with environmentally friendly and climate-friendly technology, preferably with renewable energies, such as heat pumps, wood pellet boilers or solar thermal energy. With the full impact of the program and switching to renewable energy alone, around 30,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions could be saved. The programm needs final approvment  and is meant to start in the course of 2019. Owners of residential buildings can in future apply for grants from IBB for the replacement of their old heating system with an energy-efficient and CO2-saving alternative. In addition, energy advice on building renovation and energy saving will be promoted. For the use of renewable energy additional financial incentives are set. For funding, the Senate provides for the dual budget 2020/2021 up to 6 million euros. This money could be used to promote the replacement of at least 1,200 heaters for renewable energy sources. At present there are around 66,000 oil heating systems in Berlin, and the consumption of heating oil in the housing sector is responsible for the emission of 1.2 million tonnes of CO2 (as of 2016) - that is a good 6% of the total Berlin CO emissions (20.1 million Tons, as of 2016).;;action_description5: This strategy includes inter alia the phase out of coal, which has been made legally binding with an amendment of the Berlin Energy Turnaround Act. The Berlin Senate is working to end energy production from hard coal by 2030 at the latest. Berlin's last remaining lignite-fired power plants were already decommissioned in 2017. To replace the coalfired power stations as they are closed down, gas-based CHP plants will be built which will generate both electricity and district or local heating.Further measures ensure that infrastructures are adapted in a forward-looking way, e.g. by lowering the temperature levels of heating networks and increasingly integrating thermal energy storage. District heating remains an important pillar but the gas network will retain its importance at least in the medium term. The long-term future of the gas network will depend largely on whether fossil natural gas is increasingly replaced by renewably generated gases and how district heating and the decentralised energy supply of buildings develop. (Text English broschure BEK) (u.a. E-1);;action_description6: Energetic district concepts are a central approach of the BEK 2030 in the area of <U+200B><U+200B>buildings and urban development. In May 2019, the new advisory and service center for energy-related district development funded by BEK funds will be available to support them.;;action_description7: With the joint project ZuHaus in Berlin, the Berlin Senate Department for the Environment, Transport and Climate Protection and the Consumer Center Berlin offer homeowners a free and provider-independent energy consultation in five Berlin districts.The energy consultants look at the heating and the building envelope during a home visit and recommend measures for energetic renovation such as heating exchange or insulation. They also analyze the energy consumption of electrical appliances and give tips on how to save energy.;;action_description8: A public energy utility has been founded in 2014 with a mandate to install renewable energy projects troughout the city, including on-site renewable energy generation. Public buildings will play a mayor role. A masterplan ""Solar city""-  which is in the pipeline - is meant to facilitate the expansion. Moreover, renewable energy gerenation run by tenants of buildings will be promoted.  (u.a. E 4 u. GeS 21);;action_description9: A variety of measures to make walking, cycling and public transport more attractive, including the adoption of a Berlin Mobility Act (u.a. V-1, V-3, V-4 und V-5). Berlin plans to become safer, more mobile and more climate-friendly. In a growing metropolis like Berlin, this can only succeed if the strengths of all forms of mobility – i.e. bus, rail, bicycle, car, pedestrian traffic – are taken into consideration. Ecomobility, i.e. pedestrian traffic, bicycles and public transport, has a particular role to play here because all these forms of mobility are very efficient in their use of space. The Berlin Mobility Act creates a basis in law which takes account of all interests. This is without precedent in Germany. It has been adpoted on July 5, 2018.;;action_description10: Within the framework of the ""fLotte Kommunal"" project, Spandau and Lichtenberg districts will set up ten rental stations for cargo bikes in the coming weeks, which can be hired free of charge there. Cargo bikes are not only practical but also sustainable means of transport and transportation. They are cheaper and more environmentally friendly than a motor vehicle and can even be up to six kilometers faster on inner-city distances. ""FLotte kommunal"" wants to make the freight bikes easily accessible at as many locations as possible in order to offer CO2-free bicycle rides as an alternative to private car rides. The project is part of a BEK 2030 measure to expand the sharing economy in Berlin and makes a not inconsiderable contribution to the achievement of Berlin's climate protection goals. The project is funded by the Berlin Energy and Climate Protection Program (BEK 2030) and will be expanded to other districts as well.",NA,2050,95,C40Cities2019;EUCovenantofMayors2019;GlobalCovenantofMayors2019;NAZCA,"1,2,4",1,NA,8.51744186,"Climate Alliance, DE",Supporter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AB 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, required California to reduce statewide GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. AB 32 also directed the Air Resources Board (ARB) to develop and implement regulations that reduce statewide GHG emissions. Many local governments do not have access to sufficient historical data to prepare a 1990 baseline emissions inventory, which would allow local governments to establish reduction targets that exactly mimic the state’s own targets. In its 2008 Scoping Plan, the ARB “encourages local governments to adopt a reduction goal for municipal operations emissions and move toward establishing similar goals for community emissions that parallel the state’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 15 percent from current levels by 2020.” Based on this language, many community-wide CAPs have selected a reduction target of 15% below baseline levels by 2020 to parallel the state’s target. Considering guidance from the Governor's Office of Planning and Research and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District at the time of CAP document preparation, Cupertino selected a reduction target of 15% below 2010 baseline levels by 2020 as a proxy for a return to 1990 levels. This 2020 target was also extrapolated to 2050 to determine what level of reductions the City would need to achieve 80% below 1990 levels, per the state’s long-term target.

Basic axes of the energy planning of the Municipality are the promotion of renewable energy sources, the energy savings by improvement of energy efficiency in the municipal infrastructures and the building sector and the sustainable transports.
Vision of the Municipality of Nisyros is the complete independence of the island from mining fuels. Nisyros could become a “green” island, in which the energy will emanate exclusively from renewable sources. The way to the achievement of this long-term vision has a lot of stages of development, the savings, the progressive penetration of renewables etc, and is full of challenges that the Municipality of Nisyros has to face and exploit.

Bornova has targeted 25 % reduction in its absolute CO2e emissions by
the year 2020. As an administrative region in Greater Izmir, Bornova has a
population growth rate above the national average of 1,2 %, at around 3,5%. The
urbanization rate of Bornova is 91 %,being higher than the national average of
75 %. Bornova also has a relatively larger industrial and commercial activity
within Izmir compared to other counties.The city is on the main transit roads
from Aydin, Manisa, Istanbul and Çanakkale and also is home to the Izmir bus
terminal. The long term vision of Bornova
 Municipality is
consistent with its plans to reduce its carbon footprint; i.e. urban renewal
and upgrading as well as decarbonizing and optimizing transport options.As can
be seen from the baseline inventory, which does not include the industry
contribution, the two main sources of GHG emission in Bornova are the built
environment (i.e. emissions from the building stock) and transport emissions.
The difficulty regarding decarbonization of the transport sector is that,the
main decision making body is not Bornova city since the Greater Izmir
Municipality controls theurban public transport. Consequently, the main plan of
action will concentrate on reducing energy use in the building stock, as stated
in the strategic action plan of Bornova, and focus on the urban renewal of the
area of the city presently housing up to a quarter of the municipal population,
around 100 000 people. Urban renewal will allow significantly improved
energy utilization to be integrated into the renewed building stock and at much
lower unit cost. Transport reductions will be realized by further spread of
rail system (tram and sub) into the Bornova and decarbonization measures

The most recent version was approved on 25 April 2018. The MSDF provides the spatial planning policy for development activities in Cape Town. In essence, the MSDF takes the development priorities in the City’s IDP – the five-year blueprint for governance – and fleshes them out so as to achieve the type of spatial transformation needed to address past inequalities, while optimising the use of municipal resources.The current MSDF primarily focuses on reducing the spread of development into new areas. This is achieved by encouraging the densification of targeted areas that already have municipal infrastructure in place. In this way, existing infrastructure is used more optimally, and the need for new services and public transport links into new areas is reduced. Overall, one of the key objectives of the MSDF is to compact the city by limiting geographic expansion. Apart from focusing further development in the centre of the metro, the MSDF also seeks to connect people to jobs by improving transport infrastructure and links, while limiting expansion beyond these areas. It strongly advocates for land use intensification based on transit-oriented development (TOD) and related urban design principles. It also provides a prioritised investment framework for the future roll-out of infrastructure investment in the city.To ensure that the MSDF remains relevant, it is revisited every year based on a review of urbanisation and development trends.The City is not able to estimate a cost to implementing the entire MSDF, or the staff time to have developed the strategy. Similarly, an emissions reduction estimate is unavailable for the Framework. However, it is anticipated to bring about shorter distances travelled by road (as well as a modal shift towards public transport) and therefore reduce the city’s transport emissions.;;action_description2: The City is committed to a large-scale ceilings retrofit programme which was established in 2010. The program aimed to install ceilings in old subsidised houses without water-proofing and ceilings as a priority project for improving the resilience of low-income households and vulnerable communities.  Ceilings for the 40-50 000 households will cost an estimated R500 million. The City has thus far secured R140 million and is currently implementing retrofits in identified communities. For the first 8 001 homes which have been retrofitted with insulated ceilings, there will a reduction of approximately 5 600 tonnes of carbon per annum. The ceilings project has been proven to have positive health and economic effects for the communities.;;action_description3: All of the traffic lights within the City of Cape Town area have been retrofitted with LED lighting technology. 32% of all street lights in the city have been retrofitted with energy efficiency street lighting, 17% were the initial refurbishment from metal halide to high pressure sodium street lights and since 2016, 14% of street lighting have been retrofitted with LED street lighting technology. These happen as part of an active annual refurbishment street light programme within the City of Cape Town.;;action_description4: The City of Cape Town has laid the foundation for the growth of small-scale embedded generation (SSEG) in Cape Town by implementing a policy and instituting SSEG tariffs. The SSEG programme aims to remove barriers to the rooftop PV market through sector development and to make PV more attractive to residential and commercial consumers. Many businesses and households are taking up this opportunity. The City is supporting improvements in the PV industry through active engagement, promotion and the development of ‘Rooftop PV Guidelines’ standards for installation to guide end-users.  For the safety of home owners, electricity personnel and grid infrastructure, all systems must be approved by the City through a registration process. There are currently over 192 residential and 91 commercial and industrial PV systems which have been commissioned.  This represents an embedded generation capacity of over 13MVA. Another 8MVA is currently in the planning stage.Going forward, the City will endeavour to increase the amount of SSEG installed inter alia by addressing existing barriers such as the cost of smart meters and lobbying for gaps in building wiring codes which do not fully cover all aspects of grid connected small scale embedded generation to be closed;;action_description5: The City’s solar water heater accreditation and marketing programme encourages the installation of high-pressure residential solar water heaters, and improves the reliability, quality and standard of products and installations. The programme forms part of the City’s electricity-savings campaign to reduce citywide electricity consumption, alleviate the burden of electricity costs to households and the economy, cut CO2 emissions and improve energy security.According to the last aerial count in 2015, over 46 000 solar water heaters had been installed in the Cape Town metro. These have contributed more than R900 million to the economy. These systems are reducing electricity consumption by more than 128 000 MWh per year, and are cutting carbon emissions by an annual 132 000 tonnes or more. Households are saving more than R270 million per year, which can then be circulated to the local economy.  A new count (2018) is currently underway.;;action_description6: The City of Cape Town established a greentech manufacturing hub in Atlantis in 2011 in response to the REIPPP.  An application was submitted to the national Department of Trade and Industry in 2014 for the designation of Atlantis as a special economic zone.  The SEZ was designated on the 8 June 2018 and aims to establish a green technology cluster with a focus on manufacturing and related green tech services.  Green technology was defined as technology and services that result in lower carbon emissions, are more resource efficient and are more socially inclusive.;;action_description7: Transit-orientated Development (TOD) is a priority of the City, reflected in the adoption of the Transit-Orientated Development Strategic Framework approved by Cape Town City Council in March 2016. It serves as an innovative approach to addressing sustainability, urban inefficiencies and the socio-economic disparities in Cape Town. It promotes densification along key transport nodes and corridors, driving low carbon resilient development in Cape Town. The implementation of this framework will enable the creation of greater density and mixed use development along public transport routes and build inclusivity in the city. This will shape urban form towards a more compact, connected and socially inclusive city.The City has developed a Catalytic Land Development Programme (CLDP) in support of its TOD Strategic Framework (2016). This was developed through rigorous analysis, which generated a selection of high priority sites or precincts.  One precinct identified for redevelopment is Bellville, a metropolitan node with a significant public transport interchange.  Within this precinct, a pedestrian (zero or low carbon) zone is planned, in support of non-motorised transport, public transport, TOD and urban regeneration.  A precinct planning process is underway.It is too early to estimate the effect this will have in terms of emissions reductions, especially as the programme will comprise a suite of projects. This is also why currently the total cost and local government funding cannot be determined.;;action_description8: The Smart Driver Programme is a key initiative of the City’s Greening Fleet Initiative and aims to train all City fleet drivers to develop responsible driving behaviour that will result in:   •	improved driver safety by decreasing and preventing accidents; •	drivers operating their fleet and own vehicles significantly more efficiently and cost effectively (reducing fuel usage and maintenance costs);  •	reduced vehicle carbon emissions that will have significant health and environmental benefits;  •	monitoring of drivers and vehicles who participated in the training, to establish safety, savings and CO2 emission statistics. Please note that the City is not able to provide CO2 reduction estimates at this stage due to changes in fleet size (estimates not available at time of CDP reporting). The City has procured a RAMM monitoring system (hard and soft ware) in June 2019 to monitor 1). Driver Behaviour 2.) Fuel usage and CO2 Emissions and 3). Road Safety.  The monitoring will start beginning August 2019.•	improved vehicle life span due to better driving techniques; and •	healthier drivers, better care of vehicles (appearance and maintenance), improvement in public image, established a culture of vocational pride and increasing asset life of our fleet.A tender was awarded end 2017, with Smart Driver training interventions actively taking place since January 2018. Smart Driver training is now mandatory for all City staff that are in the possession of a driver tag and are driving a City fleet vehicle. Since January 2018, the City has trained  over 2 400 City fleet drivers and has extended the training to the City’s BRT bus fleet (MyCiti), with 80 MyCiti bus drivers ( 20 from each of the 4 Vehicle Operating Companies) trained to date.All vehicles are fitted with e-tags, however effective data management systems still need to be put in place – this is currently being addressed is anticipated to start beginning August 2019. Fleet purchase tenders now include fuel efficiency as a criterion. A tree planting programme linked to the Smart Driver Programme is also in the planning phase, in partnership with the City’s Recreation and Parks Department, to offset emissions.;;action_description9: The home compositing (HC) project aims to enable Cape Town residents to compost their organic waste, diverting it from landfills. It began in 2013 as a feasibility study by the City of Cape Town to establish whether residents would use home composting (HC) containers, and how much organic waste per household would thus be diverted from landfill. A sample of 616 households from four medium and low income areas in Cape Town participated for nine months, and an average of 16.9kg of organic waste per household (HC container) per month was composted.  A reported total of 38.3 Tons of organic waste was composted (diverted from landfill) by the 41% who reported regularly, equating to a saving of 48.8 tCO2e.  As result of this success, 15 000 HC containers were purchased for distribution to households, followed by Phase 1 roll-out from April 2016,.  Phase 2 roll-out is in progress with 8280 HC containers rolled out to date.  The total projected composted waste is 1 609T with GHG emission savings of 2 048 tCO2e per annum.;;action_description10: The City of Cape Town’s Small-Scale Energy Generation (SSEG) programme promotes the uptake of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems and small wind turbines in the commercial and residential sectors by allowing electricity customers to connect to the City’s electricity grid. SSEG net consumers can import energy from and export a limited amount of energy onto the City’s grid, for which they are credited.The programme aims to remove barriers to the rooftop PV market through sector development and by making PV more attractive to consumers. This includes investigations into innovative financing mechanisms that make PVs more accessible to citizens. Communication campaigns have been a critical part of this programme to raise awareness of SSEG safety issues and the importance of ensuring legal SSEGs connections that do not compromise the City’s electricity grid. Collaboration between the City and its citizens is essential to ensure the success of the SSEG programme and to move towards a more climate-smart future together. In the absence of national legislation regarding SSEG installations and tariffs, the City assumed leadership by developing suitable SSEG tariffs, suitable bi-directional metering systems and automated billing systems that allow the purchase and sale of electricity. These are now being incorporated into the drafting of national legislation and strongly promote transparent processes.There are currently over 306 residential and 128 commercial and industrial PV systems which have been commissioned.  This represents an embedded generation capacity of over 18MVA. The cost cannot be calculated. The programme is extensive, spanning various projects, and is still expanding. Staff salaries also cannot be split into their amount of time dedicated to this programme. While it cannot calculate the total cost, the City can confirm that it covers 100% of the costs.;;action_description11: The City of Cape Town recognises that cycling is an important part of the City’s transport system and developed the Cycling Strategy to improve access to bicycles and support the growth in utility cycling across Cape Town. This Strategy was approved by Council in August 2017, following a consultation process with a broad range of City Departments and external cycling stakeholders. The six key focus areas prioritised during the development of the Cycling Strategy are: improved access to bicycles, improved safety and security, providing and maintaining cycling infrastructure, improving data capturing and monitoring, facilitating stakeholder collaboration and improving communication and education. The Cycling Strategy also seeks to improve data on cycling. By building a better evidence base, the strategy will enable more informed decisions to be made.The long term desired outcome of the Cycling Strategy is that cycling will become recognised and accepted as a safe, viable and attractive means of travel for all and that cycling’s mode share will increase from the current 1% to 8% by 2030, contributing to the City’s lower carbon development efforts.An Implementation Framework with actions is included in the Cycling Strategy.A Cycling Communication Strategy has been developed and will be rolled out in October 2019 as part of the City’s Transport Month activities. The Cycling Communication Strategy focuses on promoting commuter cycling and raising safety awareness.  Of the costs covered under the Cycling Strategy, a significant amount are covered by the national Department of Transport and so the City is unable to estimate a cost to implementing the entire strategy. The cost of the Communications Strategy is based on the consultant appointed (available on request). The City also does not have emissions reduction figures for the Cycling Strategy.;;action_description12: The City has installed rooftop photovoltaic systems on nine City municipal facilities. In total, 623 kWp has been installed and 762 kWp planned for the upcoming 1-2 years. These projects are providing an opportunity for the development of staff capacity and are demonstrating the City’s commitment to renewable energy.;;action_description13: The City has been actively involved in energy efficiency within council owned facilities since 2009 and is managing and coordinating a successful Building Energy Efficiency Retrofit Programme. Since the inception of this programme in 2009, the City has completed the retrofitting of 44 large municipal facilities. 4 buildings underwent full energy efficiency retrofits, 16 facilities were retrofitted with EE fluorescent (T5) lighting with occupation sensors and 24 facilities have been retrofitted with the new EE technology of LED lighting with occupation sensors. The programme is ongoing on an annual basis. All project buildings have an installed smart meter (AMI) to set baseline before initiative and to monitor and verify the facilities performance from retrofit completion. The team also runs a behaviour change programme to capacitate building managers and users to effectively manage electricity consumption within their buildings.;;action_description14: The City of Cape Town (together with City of Johannesburg, eThekwini Municipality and City of Tshwane) is part of the C40 South Africa Buildings Programme.  Through the programme, the City is committed to accelerating transformative climate action by delivering carbon neutrality for all new buildings by 2030. In addition, the Executive Mayor signed the Net Zero Carbon Buildings declaration at the Global Climate Action Summit in September 2018. The declaration commits the City to net zero carbon by 2030 for all new buildings and all municipal buildings; and by 2050 for all existing buildings. To meet these ambitious commitments, the City of Cape Town is currently developing regulations that that will improve energy efficiency performance and resource efficiency to ensure that all new buildings are designed and built to be carbon neutral, and that retrofits of existing buildings are as energy efficient as possible. Other approaches and interventions being pursued include: •	existing building retrofit requirements/nudges/incentives; •	incentive packages for new build; •	accelerated transition to cleaner energy supply (small scale and large scale);•	financing systems to assist home owners to make upgrade investments; and •	extensive awareness campaigns and stakeholder engagement.Please note the renewable energy production figure provided (271) is the MW capacity targeted for 2030. The project is ongoing and projected to entail various components to meet its 2030 and 2050 timelines; as such, a total cost cannot be calculated.;;action_description15: The Western Cape Industrial Symbiosis Programme (WISP) is a free facilitation service, based in Cape Town that connects companies so that they can identify and realise the benefits of using unused or residual resources (materials, energy, water etc.). WISP fills a gap that currently exists in the manufacturing sector (most notably in SMEs) - a neutral platform, dedicated capacity and technical expertise to identify actionable opportunities, at no cost to companies. It is available to all companies in the manufacturing sector, no matter the company size or industry. The resource exchanges facilitated by WISP divert waste from landfill (36 600 tonnes to date); generate financial benefits for members by bypassing landfill gate fees and earning revenue from waste materials (R67.9 million has been generated in financial benefits thus far); reduce the carbon intensity of production processes, and create jobs, ultimately making the manufacturing sector more competitive and resilient to climate change. WISP is one of the City of Cape Town's vehicles to drive its Zero Waste to Landfill Strategy. It also recently launched its enterprise development programme, the first of its kind in the world, aimed at creating companies that will provide new waste solutions to companies in Cape Town. At a minimum, WISP targets a net zero CO2 reduction impact with every resource exchange or ‘synergy’. Each facilitator can verify the expected net CO2 reduction, using the carbon calculator, before a synergy is implemented by a member. WISP promotes the following measures: •	uptake of secondary materials reducing fossil GHG emissions associated with material production and transporting the material to market. •	the use of green energy sources via the use of biomass boilers and rooftop solar PV to decrease the local manufacturing sector’s reliance on fossil fuels. •	the re-use and recycling of industrial water as far as possible to decrease potable water demand in manufacturing sector. Furthermore, WISP drives skills development through partnerships; with among others, SAREBI, Technology Innovation Agency (TIA), Learn-to-Earn, Furntech, South African Renewable Energy Technology Centre (SARETEC). WISP’s job calculator (developed by expert economists) uses local economic multipliers to calculate the number of additional indirect and induced jobs created based on direct job creation, private investments and additional revenue generated by members. Total direct jobs created due to WISP by June 2020 is therefore forecast as 70 with an additional 143 indirect and induced jobs. The project has been funded by provincial government in the past and is currently funded by the City of Cape Town Enterprise and Investment Department, while being managed by the green economy agency GreenCape. The carbon emissions reductions reflected may therefore not all apply to emissions within official City boundaries. It is also important to note that WISP focuses on all manufacturing wastes, not just dry recyclables.;;action_description16: The City-wide Non-Motorised Transport (NMT) Programme was initiated in 2009 for the implementation of pedestrian and cycle projects. During Phases 1 and 2 of the Programme, 36 projects were completed, and 8 projects from Phase 2 are currently still under construction. The planning, design and implementation of Phase 3 is currently underway.;;action_description17: The City of Cape Town has a registered Programme of Activities (PoA) under the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Clean Development Mechanism  (CDM) for emission reduction of landfill gas at its active and closed disposal facilities. Currently the City’s Coastal Park landfill project is the only registered project activity (CPA) and has been operational since January 2018. The Bellville landfill site is in the process of being registered but is not currently fully operational. The Vissershok landfill gas extraction systems will be installed in 2019/2020 financial year and will also be registered under the PoA. The initial phase of the project will only flare and Phase 2 of the project includes the conversion of the landfill gas to electricity.;;action_description18: The City of Cape Town’s Electricity Savings Campaign, which targets residential and commercial consumers, aims to reduce electricity consumption through a wide range of behavioural and technological changes.  The campaign started with a focus on no-cost and low-cost advice, and thereafter moved to invest-to-save options, particularly promoting the use of solar water heaters, and heat pumps.  A dedicated Solar Water Heater Accreditation Programme was established under this programme by the City which accredits a set of quality service providers and products, and inspects installations in order to improve households’ trust. The Solar Water Heater Accreditation programme is currently under review to align with new technologies and market drivers. A media campaign, website, posters, publications, exhibitions and events are targeted at higher-usage electricity consumers. It offers tips and financial savings information for saving electricity; and information about energy saving technologies. The campaign now focuses on rooftop PV installations. For the commercial sector, the Energy Efficiency Forum was established in 2009 as a pioneering public-private initiative by the City of Cape Town in partnership with Eskom. In 2017, due to the acute drought, the Forum played a key role in promoting and enabling knowledge sharing in water efficiency for businesses, and in early 2019, offered a useful platform for sharing innovative ideas around coping with the persistent loadshedding at the time.While the reductions in emissions and energy consumption cannot be calculated directly for the campaign, it has played a significant role in promoting technological and behavioural changes that would lead to emissions reductions.Please note that the costs provided reflect an estimate of annual costs.;;action_description19: Transit-orientated Development (TOD) is a priority of the City, reflected in the adoption of the Transit-Orientated Development Strategic Framework approved by Cape Town City Council in March 2016. It serves as an innovative approach to addressing sustainability, urban inefficiencies and the socio-economic disparities in Cape Town. It will promote densification along key transport nodes, driving low carbon resilient development in Cape Town. The implementation of this framework will enable the creation of greater density and mixed use development along public transport routes and build inclusivity in the city. This will shape urban form towards a more compact, connected and socially inclusive city.;;action_description20: In March 2017, the City of Cape Town Council approved its Travel Demand Management (TDM) Strategy. TDM encompasses a range of techniques that aim to encourage people to make more sustainable travel choices, through use of existing technology, capacity and infrastructure. While some of the proposed interventions are internal to the City as an organisation, all are intended to influence behaviour among all residents, through leading by example. The implementation/rollout of the strategy therefore has the potential to reduce congestion in the city and contribute to achieving the City’s energy and carbon targets as well as improve liveability, air quality and the economic and social burden of extended travel times for residents. A significant component of the TDM Strategy is the Flexible Working Programme (FWP).  The FWP aims to change travel patterns of City employees, leading to fewer private vehicles on the arterial routes during the peak periods, and more public transport trips taken off-peak. It will enable a variety of different ways of arranging working hours, including remote work arrangements and compressed work weeks for employees. The City is leading by example by currently implementing the FWP (since 2018) and promoting the roll-out there-of across Cape Town.The benefits of the FWP are anticipated to include:•	Reducing the employee’s need to travel, or their travel distance, through occasionally working from home or at a satellite office •	The ability to travel outside the peak traffic period to reduce employee’s time on the road – reduced congestion (therefore reduced pollution and CO2 emissions)•	Reduced commuting fuel costs•	The ability to match work schedules to time schedules for shoulder-peak of public transport, or other alternative commuting options (e.g. carpooling) – increased use of public transport and carpooling/ car sharing•	Reduced stress from congestion and gridlock•	Increased work output and quality – a known outcome of reduced travel-related stress•	Matching employee hours to their peak productivity periods (e.g. early versus late energy)•	Reduced tardiness and absence due to personal commitments•	Reduced parking requirements at the workplaceFigures for emissions reductions are currently unavailable as metrics have not yet been put in place.  Assistance is being sought to identify the most efficient, automated system of measuring emissions reductions. The total cost of the project, which in part will be absorbed into staff time, is still to be determined.;;action_description21: Since 2013, the City has rolled out a smart metering programme within its council owned municipal facilities for accurate measurement, savings verification and reporting.  To date the programme has led to the installation of over 700 meters in 567 facilities, which comprise 41% of the total number of listed municipal facilities (approximately 1365 facilities listed) requiring smart metering. The City has developed and launched (in November 2018) an application called SmartFacility, to better access the live consumption readings, view the data via user friendly dashboards and extract summarised reports that assist with proactively monitoring and managing facility consumption usage and performance of facilities. The automated reporting also assists with making decisions around energy efficiency and renewable energy optimisation interventions within council facilities to achieve and report on given targets. Since the launch of SmartFacility, the team have trained 100 municipal officials that manage council owned facilities. The fields for emissions reduction and energy savings do not apply here as metering does not provide direct emissions. However, it does assist with better measurement of the mitigation actions and emissions reduction.;;action_description22: The City of Cape Town is committed to retrofitting all subsidised homes built prior to 2005 with insulated ceilings. This will improve the energy efficiency of homes, and residents’ health and quality of life. Thus far over 11000 homes have been retrofitted with insulated ceilings, with an estimated carbon reduction of 7700 tCO2 per annum. The most recent monitoring and evaluation report was produced in 2019, clearly illustrating the positive impact on households in the reduced costs, with improved health being the most significant. There are still approximately 40,000 subsidised (RDP) homes in need of ceiling retrofits and other energy efficiency improvements. The City of Cape Town’s Sustainable Energy Markets (SEM) Low Income Energy Services Branch continues to look for funding opportunities and creative ways to progress this projects and its impactful work. Monitoring and surveying will continue to be done in these communities for a more extensive understanding of the long-term impacts of the projects.;;action_description23: Think Twice"" dry -recyclable collection service Extending the kerb-side collection of containerised dry-recyclables (""Think Twice"") from formal households designated for  separation and sorting at Council Material Recovery Facilities;;action_description24: Although lower in carbon intensity than electricity, the transport sector in Cape Town accounts for the greatest overall use of energy in Cape Town (64% of total energy consumed, roughly 30% of total CO2 emissions produced) and is rapidly increasing, therefore requiring particular attention in the City’s low carbon development efforts. A major focus includes achieving an efficient and integrated public transport system, as outlined in the City’s Comprehensive Integrated Transport Plan (2018-2023).One of the programmes under this Plan includes the roll-out of the City’s Bus Rapid Transit System, called the MyCiTi.  The BRT system was launched in 2010 and incorporates a network of trunk and feeder routes, using a fleet of modern, energy-efficient buses travelling on dedicated busways. It registers passengers boarding over 95 000 times a day and is in high demand during the peak periods. The City is currently planning the rolling out of Phase 2A of the MyCiTi which will create a new bus link between Khayelitsha / Mitchells Plain, and Claremont / Wynberg. The City has retrofitted all MyCiTi depots with EV supporting infrastructure, and incorporated EV infrastructure in the design of the BRT Phase 2A corridor project. Solar panels are being installed in MyCiTi depots to offset the grid service with clean electricity.The MyCiTi service and infrastructure supports the complementary use of non-motorised transport for the first/last mile, and park-and-ride facilities which are particularly popular in areas of high car occupancy.The City also implements marketing campaigns to increase MyCiTi usage – these are focused on raising occupancy during the off-peak periods, while the communications focuses on ensuring that commuters are aware of all changes that might impact them.It is too early to estimate the resultant emissions reduction from the BRT system, and total cost is not available at present.;;action_description25: The City’s solar water heater (SWH) accreditation and marketing programme was developed and implemented to encourage the installation of high-pressure residential solar water heaters, and to improve the reliability, quality and standard of products and installations. The programme formed part of the City’s electricity-savings campaign to reduce citywide electricity consumption, alleviate the burden of electricity costs to households and the economy, cut CO2 emissions and improve energy security.The SWH programme was used as stimulus for the entire SWH market in Cape Town so the outcomes are calculated on all SWH’s installed in Cape Town, not just those installed by the accredited service providers. A sample GIS count was conducted in 2017 to generate the following estimates:  Over 61 000 solar water heaters have been installed in the Cape Town metro. These have contri",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uted more than R1.2 billion to the economy. These systems are reducing electricity consumption by more than 170 000 MWh per year, and are cutting carbon emissions by an annual 177 000 tonnes or more. Based on these approximate per annum energy savings figures, households are saving more than R370 million per year, which can then be circulated to the local economy.  A more comprehensive flyover count is currently being conducted (2019).As the programme is currently under review, the costs for the entire programme are unavailable.;;action_description26: The City recognises the need to diversify its electricity supply sources. One of the ways it can do this is by purchasing electricity directly from independent power producers (IPPs). However, government policy only allows these IPPs to sell electricity directly to the national utility Eskom. The City of Cape Town is therefore currently challenging National Government in the courts for the right to purchase renewable energy directly from IPPs. This requires obtaining a Section 34 determination in accordance with the New Generation Capacity Regulations in the Electricity Generation Act to allow the City to procure 150 MW of solar energy and 280 MW of wind energy from IPPs. The court proceedings are anticipated to commence in August 2019.If successful in our court challenge, the City would opt for a public tender and solicit proposals from IPPs. The generation profile and price of power generated from IPPs would differ based on technology.The City is also exploring the feasibility of building a fleet of smaller City-owned renewable generation plants and developing a ‘wheeling’ framework which will allow independent generators to sell electricity directly to electricity consumers embedded in the City’s electricity grid.;;action_description27: The Cycling Strategy for the City of Cape Town was developed with the input from a broad range of City Departments and external cycling stakeholders to encourage and grow the modal share of utility cycling across Cape Town. This Strategy was approved by Council in August 2017. Six Key Focus Areas were identified during the development of the Strategy and focus on growing Utility Cycling:  improve access to affordable bicycles, improve safety and security, provide and maintain cycling infrastructure, improve data collection and monitoring, improve stakeholder collaboration and improve communication and education. The long term desired outcome of the Cycling Strategy is to increase cycling modal share from the current 1% to 8% by 2030.;;action_description28: The City is currently challenging National Government in the courts for the right to purchase renewable energy directly from Independent Power Producers (IPPs). The City is also exploring the feasibility of building a fleet of smaller City-owned renewable generation plants and developing a ‘wheeling’ framework which will allow independent generators to sell electricity directly to electricity consumers embedded in the City’s electricity grid.;;action_description29: The City’s home composting project aims to enable Cape Town residents to compost their organic waste, diverting it from landfills. It began in 2013 as a feasibility study by the City of Cape Town to establish whether residents would use home composting (HC) containers, and how much organic waste per household would thus be diverted from landfill. A sample of 616 households from four medium and low income areas in Cape Town participated for nine months, and an average of 16.9kg of organic waste per household (HC container) per month was composted.  A reported total of 38.3 Tons of organic waste was composted (diverted from landfill) by the 41% who reported regularly, equating to a saving of 48.8 tCO2e.  As result of this success, 15 000 HC containers were purchased for distribution to households, followed by Phase 1 roll-out from April 2016 (first come first service basis). Phase 2 roll-out is in progress with 8280 HC containers rolled out to date.  The total projected composted waste is 1 609T with GHG emission savings of 2 048 tCO2e per annum. Please note the total cost given here reflect the costs for the feasibility study and implementation of Phase 1-3," integrated with staff and vehicle/fuel costs under the Solid Waste Management Department.;;action_description30: Extending the kerb-side collection of containerised dry-recyclables (""""Think Twice"""") from formal households designated for separation and sorting at Council Material Recovery Facilities:The City of Cape Town is committed to sustainable waste management", including investing in and developing sustainable recycling strategies. To this end, the City has developed a recycling program known as Think Twice. Think Twice is the core message underpinning the City’s recycling service and is the brand that is linked to the free door-to-door voluntary recycling project aimed at reducing waste to landfills.Residents living in select areas of the city can sign up to the Think Twice initiative that offers a free household recycling service to those in the Northern Suburbs, the Atlantic area (all the way from Blouberg down to Hout Bay), the South Peninsula, the Helderberg area and Kraaifontein. The curb side collection programme picks up paper, plastic, glass and tin, and has recently expanded to include the Southern Suburbs area. While select neighbourhoods have been appointed a green-lid recycling bin, most participants are merely asked to place their reusable goods in clear plastic bags, which can be loaded on top of other rubbish in standard black bins. Collection happens on the same day as regular refuse pick-up, except in areas provided with bins; here, pick-ups are done the day after standard refuse collection (areas where rubbish is collected on Fridays will have their recyclables collected on Mondays).The programme is now offered to over 170 000 households across Cape Town and diverts over ±20 000 t of recyclables from landfill every year.;;action_description31: At 64% of total energy consumption, the transport sector now dominates the energy picture of Cape Town. Currently, road and rail transport account for 29% of Cape Town's total emissions per year. The City is busy rolling out its Integrated Rapid Transit programme which seeks to connect the taxi, train, bus, pedestrian and bicycle routes into one coherent network. This project costs >R1billion. The project promotes the use of public transport as opposed to private vehicle use. The Bus Rapid Transit system (BRT) incorporates a network of main and feeder routes, using a fleet of modern, energy efficient buses travelling on dedicated busways.  The City is in the process of procuring 11 electric buses to use as a pilot project in Cape Town.  The City will assess their functionality for use in the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and quality bus services.  Particular focus will be on the extent to which they reduce lifecycle costs.;;action_description32: The City-wide Non-Motorised Transport (NMT) Programme was initiated in 2009 for the implementation of pedestrian and cycle projects. During Phases 1 and 2 of the Programme, 32 projects have been completed, and projects from Phase 3 are currently under construction. The procurement process for Phase 4 is currently underway. The objectives with the NMT Programme are to expand the City’s NMT infrastructure, encourage walking and cycling as modes of travel for commuting purposes and the creation of safer pedestrian and cycling environments.  Improvements to support accessibility for people with special needs (physically disabled, elderly, and parents with infants) are included in the design and construction of all projects. NMT project prioritization is informed by existing desire lines with high pedestrian and cycle usage, improve access to public facilities (schools, hospitals, clinics, etc.), access to public transport services (bus, minibus-taxi and rail) and to major employment areas.The implementation of new NMT facilities provides a range of benefits to local communities.  The design stage entails inter-alia sidewalks, cycle ways, hard and soft landscaping, as well as bicycle racks and street lighting where warranted.  The requirements of special needs users are included in these projects.  Employment and training opportunities are included in the EPWP Programme.Although the NMT Strategy will result in carbon emission reductions along certain routes where commuters will be able to shift from vehicles to non-motorized modes, these have not yet been estimated, and the majority of users are commuters who already walk/cycle to employment.The total cost entails that which covered Phase 1 and 2, and the total cost provided by local government would be the same, with grant funding from national government included.;;action_description33: The City of Cape Town’s Electricity Savings Campaign, which targets residential and commercial consumers, aims to reduce electricity consumption through a wide range of behavioural and technological changes.  The campaign started with a focus on no-cost and low-cost advice, and has recently moved to invest-to-save options, particularly promoting the use of solar water heaters, and heat pumps.  A dedicated Solar Water Heater Accreditation Programme has been established by the City which accredits a set of quality service providers and products, and inspects installations in order to improve households’ trust.. A media campaign, website, posters, publications, exhibitions and events are targeted at higher-usage electricity consumers. It offers tips and financial savings information for saving electricity; and information about energy saving technologies. The campaign now also covers rooftop PV installations. For the commercial sector, the Energy Efficiency Forum was established in 2009 as a pioneering public-private initiative by the City of Cape Town in partnership with Eskom. In 2017, due to the acute drought, the Forum played a key role in promoting and enabling knowledge sharing in water efficiency for businesses.;;action_description34: Cape Town’s Municipal Spatial Development Framework (MSDF) 2017-2022 sets out the spatial vision and development priorities to achieve a reconfigured, inclusive spatial form for Cape Town.. It  will guide public and private investment decisions that will affect Cape Town’s future spatial structure. It identifies areas where development is desirable and/or areas where urban development is discouraged.The MSDF provides a spatial vision and direction that informs submissions, motivations and the assessments of development proposals and applications from the public and private sector. It strongly advocates for land use intensification based on transit-oriented development (TOD) and related urban design principles. It also provides a prioritised investment framework for the future role out of infrastructure investment in the City. While the MSDF doesn’t grant or remove land use rights, it is the principal policy tool when the City evaluates applications for new or enhanced land use rights. Importantly, the decisions made by the Municipal Planning Tribunal on land development applications must be consistent with the MSDF;;action_description35: The City recently begun a Low carbon new build programme, with a focus on developing and implementing transformational policies and programmes towards improving energy efficiency performance and resource efficiency to ensure that all new buildings are designed and built to be carbon neutral, and that retrofits of existing buildings are as energy efficient as possible. This forms part of the City’s participation in the C40 SA Buildings Programme.Cape Town (in conjunction with the other cities) is considering the development of a by-law that  aims to improve energy efficiency performance and resource efficiency to ensure that all new buildings are designed and built to be carbon neutral," and that retrofits of existing buildings are as energy efficient as possible.""",NA,NA,NA,Carbonn2019;CDPCities2018;GlobalCovenantofMayors2019;C40Cities2019;NAZCA,4,NA,1641.080164,NA,NA,NA

It has been in operation since 2005.;;action_description2: The Blatchford District is an area of 536 acres that will be home to up to 30,000 Edmontonians living and working in a sustainable community that uses 100% renewable energy, is carbon neutral, and significantly reduces its ecological footprint. It is currently under development, with a district energy centre under construction, and lots now available for sale.;;action_description3: By 2030, approximately 100 buildings owned by the city will have had energy audits and energy retrofits completed for them.;;action_description4: In 2018, Edmonton launched its Residential Solar Program.  This is the first direct greenhouse gas reduction program that has been implemented under the Energy Transition Strategy.  Leveraging the existing Provincial Solar Program, Edmonton combines a powerful online solar potential engagement tool with educational workshops for residents and industry with a $0.15 per watt installed solar rebate.  Although it is still early days for the program, Energy Efficiency Alberta data suggests that Edmonton is seeing a participation rate that is 10% above the Alberta average.  To date, Edmonton's solar program has catalyzed over 170 installs with an installed capacity exceeding 1 MW.;;action_description5: The City of Edmonton will procure enough electricity from renewable sources to meet 100% of its civic operations electricity consumption for 2019.;;action_description6: This builds on the energy audit and labelling component of the same program (described above) by offering home owners rebates for energy efficiency improvements they make to their homes that are aligned with the evaluation they received.;;action_description7: Between 2019 and 2030, 20 MW of solar PV system capacity will be installed on city buildings and properties, generating 17,520 MWh of electricity annually to the city.;;action_description8: 2018 was the first full year of operating Edmonton's nation leading residential energy labelling program.  This is a program that provides residents an EnerGuide evaluation (a personalized road map to the improvement of the home's energy efficiency) and a means to compare the energy performace of both new and existing homes across Edmonton, through an innovative mapping platform.  The program is supported through a grant from Natural Resources Canada.  By the last quarter of 2018, a total of 160 exisiting homes have taken advantage of the program (87 in 2018 which is 50% of the target).  The labelling program is very successful in the new home market with nearly 700 new homes registered on the site (representing 20 Champion Builders) which is 93% of the target.  Program changes are being made for implementation in 2019 to increase participation in the existing home market including integration with Realtor.ca and the introduction of a retrofit incentive that is aligned with the Provincial Home Energy Plan program.;;action_description9: The City of Edmonton will transition 440 of its buses (approximately half of its fleet) from diesel to electric in two batches - 220 at a time, beginning in 2023.

This is scheduled to be complete by 2030, from which point on approximately 5,100 tonnes of GHGs will be saved per year due to this action.;;action_description12: The Building Energy Benchmarking Program is another first in Canada; a voluntary program that invites Edmonton's large commercial, institutional, industrial, and multi-family buildings to submit their energy profile data to the City for benchmarking and market sharing.  Utilizing the EnergyStar Portfolio manager tool, the City will benchmark the submitted properties to the national EnergyStar rating system as well as the Energy Use Intensity of similar like buildings regionally and nationally.  This allows building owners and operators to understand their overall use in the context of the performance of other buildings.  As part of the program, participants gain access to an incentive to conduct an ASHRAE LEVEL II audit, providing these building operators with detailed information on where they can reduce their energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.  The first year of the program was 2017; going into 2018, 171 buildings (60 civic and 111 public) are registered for the program, which represents an over 70% increase in participation, tracking very close to the target of 200 buildings in year 2. In addition, 13 buildings took advantage of the City’s rebate to receive an energy audit.;;action_description13: Brownfields are abandoned, idle or underutilized commercial or industrial properties where past actions have caused or may have caused environmental contamination, but where there is a potential for redevelopment.
